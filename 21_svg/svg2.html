        <h1>Animation</h1>
        <p>Because SVG is just a special sort of HTML, we can write &
            modify SVGs using Javascript the same way we have been
            modifying HTML.  The first JS function in
            <code>svg2.js</code> moves a circle across the window.</p>

        <svg id="one">
            <circle r="10" cx="0" cy="60" />
        </svg>

        <p id="instruction">Make another SVG below, with one circle.
            Animate the circle so that it moves across the SVG.  When it
            gets all the way to the right, make it start over at the right
            hand side.</p>

        <p id="instruction">Make another SVG below, with one circle.
            Animate the circle so that it moves across the SVG.  When it gets all
            the way to the right, have it reverse direction and move
            left.  Do the same when it gets to the left edge.</p>

        <p id="instruction">For your next animation, give the circle a
            velocity that isn't straight horizontal. Bounce off any of the
            four sides of the SVG.</p>

        <p id="instruction">Animate the small circle below so that it
            moves along the large circle.  The next drawing down
            illustrates the sin and cosine functions, which may help.</p>

        <svg>
            <circle fill="none" r="50" cx="60" cy="60" stroke="black" />
            <circle id="orbit" fill="red" r="8" cx="110" cy="60" />
        </svg>

        <p>The distance AC is 50.  The distance AB is
            <code>50*sin(θ)</code>.  The distance BC is
            <code>50*cos(θ)</code>.  In Javascript, we need to write
            <code>Math.cos</code> or <code>Math.sin</code>.  Remember to
            express angles in radians, and to add in the center position
            of the circle.</p>

«        <svg id="three">
            <circle fill="none" r="50" cx="60" cy="60" stroke="black" />
            <circle id="orbit2" fill="red" r="3" cx="103.3" cy="85" />
            <polyline fill="none" stroke="teal"
                      points="60,60 103.3,60 103.3,85 60,60" />
            <text x="60" y="60">C</text>
            <text x="103.3" y="60" id="B">B</text>
            <text x="103.3" y="85" id="A">A</text>
        </svg>
        <p id="instruction">Animate the drawing above so that the red
            circle moves around the big circle, and the lines & text move
            with it.  You can use <code>line</code> instead of
            <code>polyline</code> if that is easier.</p>

        <h1>User Input</h1>
        <h2>Buttons</h2>

        <p>Our programs can respond to buttons the same way as
            tic-tac-toe or Battleship, and then change an SVG. </p>

        <p id="instruction">Copy one of your animation above that
            moves only in the X direction and bounces.  Add two buttons to
            move the Y position up and down.  What should happen when the
            Y value is too big or too small to fit in the SVG?</p>

        <p id="instruction">Copy your orbit animation from above.  Add
            two buttons to increase &amp; decrease the radius of the
            orbit.  You will probably need a new variable to keep track of
            this radius.</p>

        <h2>Keyboard Input</h2>

        <p>We can also respond to keyboard input. In the SVG below,
            Mouse over the SVG below, and press the right arrow key to
            move the circle.  Read the Javascript to see how it works.</p>

        <svg id="key1">
            <circle r="10" cx="10" cy="60" />
        </svg>

        <p id="instruction">Modify the Javascript to respond to all 4
            arrow keys, moving the circle in the appropriate
            direction.</p>

        <p id="instruction">Copy your bouncing animation from above,
            and modify it so that pressing one of the arrow keys at any
            time makes the circle start moving in that direction.  It
            should keep moving in that direction until it bounces or
            another key is pressed.</p>

        <p id="instruction">Make another copy of your bouncing
            animation.  Change it so that you keep track of the direction
            (angle) that the circle is moving, instead of the X and Y
            velocities.  You will need <code>Math.sin</code> and
            <code>Math.cos</code> again.  Then make two keys change the
            current travel direction clockwise and counterclockwise.</p>
