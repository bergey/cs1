        <p>We can describe images with HTML also.  When we've learned
            this image language, we'll also be able to write
            Javascript to make more elaborate images.  The image
            language is called SVG (short for Scalable Vector
            Graphics) and every image is inside an <code>SVG</code>
            tag.</p>

        <p>If you want to make something I haven't taught, <a
                                                               href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">Mozilla
            has all the details</a>.</p>

        <h1>Circles</h1>
        <p>We'll start with a single circle.  A circle is described by
            its radius and the position of its center.  If you leave
            off any of these 3 required attributes, most browsers
            won't draw the circle at all.  All dimensions &
            coördinates are in pixels.  The center position is
            described by the X (horizontal) position and the Y
            (vertical) position.  (0,0) is the upper left, and
            coördinates increase to the right and
            <strong>down</strong>.  I often write coördinates as
            (x,y), but SVG doesn't use that notation.</p>
        <svg>
            <circle r="50" cx="60" cy="50"></circle>
        </svg>
        <p class="instruction">Make a new SVG with one smaller circle</p>
        <p class="instruction">Make a new SVG with a circle that is near the right hand side of the image.</p>
        <p class="instruction">Make an SVG with two circles. Make sure neither one is entirely inside the other.</p>

        <h1>Color</h1>
        <p>Our drawings are much more interesting if we add color.   We can specify two kinds of color, the <code>fill</code> color and the outline color.  For now, we'll just use the <code>fill</code>.  Like CSS colors, we can use color names, RGB values, or hexadecimal (0-F) values that also represent RGB.  Here's a circle that isn't black.<p>
            <svg>
                <circle r="30" cx="120" cy="50" fill="blue">
            </svg>
            <p class="instruction">Draw two circles with different colors</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a bullseye, with three circles of different radiī, different colors, and the same center point.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a traffic light, with three circles of different colors, one above the other.</p>

            <h1>Rectangles</h1>
            <p>Circles are not the only shape we can make.  SVG describes rectangles with the <code>rect</code> tag.  A <code>rect</code> has a coördinate for the upper left corner, a width, and a height.  For now, we will only draw rectangles with vertical and horizontal sides.</p>
            <svg>
                <rect x="40" y="20" width="80" height="80" />
            </svg>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a rectangle taller than it is wide.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a rectangle wider than it is tall.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Copy your traffic light from above, and draw a rectangle around it.  What happens if <code>rect</code> comes before the circles?  What happens if <code>rect</code> comes after the circles?</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a square, and 4 circles. Place the circles the center of each circle is at a different corner of the square.</p>

            <h1>Stroke / Outline</h1>
            <p>We can set the outline of a shape using the attribute <code>stroke</code>.  Here are a few ways of using <code>stroke</code>.</p>
            <svg width="300" height="200">
                <circle cx="50" cy="100" r="40" stroke="green" />
                <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="40" fill="none" stroke="blue" />
                <circle cx="250" cy="100" r="40" fill="none" stroke="red" stroke-width="3" />
            </svg>
            <p class="instruction">Redraw your bullseye with thick black lines between the circles.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a tic-tac-toe board.  Use
            <code>fill=none</code>.  How many rectangles do you
            need?</p>
            <p>All of your geometry will be useful
                for computer graphics.  You can use the Javascript console
                in your browser to work out the math.  Helpful functions
                include <code>Math.sqrt()</code>, <code>Math.sin()</code>,
                and <code>Math.cos()</code>.  Remember that sin & cos take
                their inputs in radians — 360° = 2π radians.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a Venn diagram with three
                overlapping circles.   Your SVG should look something like this:</p>
            <img src="venn.png">

            <h1>Lines</h1>
            <p>We can draw a line between two points using the
            <code>line</code> element.  The line is defined by the
            (x,y) coördinates of its two endpoints.  We use
            <code>stroke</code> and <code>stroke-width</code> to
            describe how to draw the line</p>
            <svg>
                <line x1="0" y1="0" x2="100" y2="100" stroke="black" />
            </svg>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a square using four lines.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw your tic-tac-toe board using
            lines.  You can use a <code>rect</code> for the outer
                boarder, but use <code>line</code> to divide it up.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a circle with a triangle inside, any way you like.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a circle with a <em>right</em>
            triangle inside.  Put one vertex of the triangle at the
            center of the circle, and one on the edge of the circle.
                Use the math functions described above.</p>

            <h2>Polyline</h2>
            <p>We can also make "lines" that connect several points
            with a line between each point.  This saves repeating each
            point twice, when drawing shapes like our triangle
                above. We give all the points as a single attribute <code>points</code>.</p>
            <svg>
                <polyline fill="none"  stroke="teal" stroke-width="2"
                          points="20,20 20,40 40,40 40,60 60,60 60,80 80,80 80,100 100,100 100,20 20,20" />
            </svg>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a polyline with 5 points, each down and to the right from the one before.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a polyline with 5 points, each up and to the right from the one before.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a five-pointed star.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw a regular hexagon.</p>

            <h2>Text</h2>
            <p>We can write text at any point in our SVG.  The text
            goes <em>inside</em> the <code>text</code> element, just
                as it would in a <code>p</code> tag.</p>
            <svg>
                <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="red"/>
                <text x="80" y="100">STOP!</text>
            </svg>

            <p class="instruction">Draw something with at least one
                text tag and at least one other shape.</p>

            <h2>Transformations and Groups</h2>
            <p>Often the easiest way to describe a shape is in terms
            of some other shape and a transformation.  For instance,
            if we have several copies of the same shape, instead of
            calculating coördinates for every copy, we can copy and
            paste the same SVG tags, and wrap each copy in a
            transformation describing how much to translate (move) the
            copy.  We'll write our <code>transform</code> attributes
            on <code>g</code> tags.  <code>g</code> is for
            <em>group</em>.  <code>g</code> is a bit like
            <code>div</code> — it doesn't draw anything by itself, but
            it helps us group other elements to put them where we
            want.</p>
            <svg>
                <g transform="translate(30,30)">
                    <polyline fill="blue" points="0,30 26,-15 -26,-15 0,30" />
                </g>
                <g transform="translate(90,30)">
                    <polyline fill="blue" points="0,30 26,-15 -26,-15 0,30" />
                </g>
                <g transform="translate(150,30)">
                    <polyline fill="blue" points="0,30 26,-15 -26,-15 0,30" />
                </g>
                <g transform="translate(90,90)">
                    <polyline fill="blue" points="0,30 26,-15 -26,-15 0,30" />
                </g>
            </svg>
            <p class="instruction">Make 5 copies of your 5-pointed
            star from above, translated so they don't overlap.  You
                may need to make the SVG bigger.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Draw 3 copies of your hexagon in
                different colors, so they touch but do not overlap.</p>
            <p>Translation is not the only sort of Transformation.  We
            can also also rotate and scale our drawings.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Use <code>scale()</code> to make 4 copies of your hexagon at different sizes.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Use <code>rotate</code> to turn
            your tic-tac-toe board at some angle.  The argument to
            <code>rotate</code> is in degrees.  Don't pick 90° or any
            multiple of 90°.</p>
            <p>You can specify more than one transformation on the same element.  See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform#Rotating_and_Translating_an_SVG_element">this example from Mozilla.</a>.</p>
