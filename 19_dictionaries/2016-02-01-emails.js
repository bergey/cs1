Anyway, this is\nthe right place to ask these questions, and we would love to have you work\non diagrams for the next SoC.  Here are some answers to your specific\nquestions:\n\n1) Generally we are interested in making the installation process as\npainless as possible for users.  External C libraries complicate the\ninstallation process a lot.  So in general I am interested in\nreimplementing things like this in Haskell so that we could use them\nwithout incurring an external dependency.  With that said, I do not think\nthis would make a good SoC project (that page is a list of projects in\ngeneral, not necessarily just SoC projects).  It would not take the whole\nsummer and even if it did, it would be hard to justify in the context of\nSoC.\n\n2) I think working on a GUI application would make a great summer project,\nif we gave it an appropriate scope/focus.  I would really like to have\n*someone* start working on a GUI application this summer, whether it is\nyou, some other GSoC student, or one of my own research students.\n\nNote there are probably other interesting summer projects we could find\nthat are not listed on that page.  If you haven't already, I suggest taking\nsome time to play around with diagrams, make some examples, even submit a\nfew patches prior to the SoC application period.  That will both help you\nfigure out something you are really interested to work on, and also help us\nmake a strong case for accepting you.\n\n-Brent\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Nov 23, 2015 at 8:50 PM <mchavinda@colgate.edu> wrote:\n\n> Hi Brent,\n>\n> Thanks.

Anyway, this is\nthe right place to ask these questions, and we would love to have you work\non diagrams for the next SoC.  Here are some answers to your specific\nquestions:\n\n1) Generally we are interested in making the installation process as\npainless as possible for users.  External C libraries complicate the\ninstallation process a lot.  So in general I am interested in\nreimplementing things like this in Haskell so that we could use them\nwithout incurring an external dependency.  With that said, I do not think\nthis would make a good SoC project (that page is a list of projects in\ngeneral, not necessarily just SoC projects).  It would not take the whole\nsummer and even if it did, it would be hard to justify in the context of\nSoC.\n\n2) I think working on a GUI application would make a great summer project,\nif we gave it an appropriate scope/focus.  I would really like to have\n*someone* start working on a GUI application this summer, whether it is\nyou, some other GSoC student, or one of my own research students.\n\nNote there are probably other interesting summer projects we could find\nthat are not listed on that page.  If you haven't already, I suggest taking\nsome time to play around with diagrams, make some examples, even submit a\nfew patches prior to the SoC application period.  That will both help you\nfigure out something you are really interested to work on, and also help us\nmake a strong case for accepting you.\n\n-Brent\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Nov 23, 2015 at 8:50 PM <mchavinda@colgate.edu> wrote:\n\n> Hi Brent,\n>\n> Thanks.

, {"subject":"Re: [diagrams] (QDiagram b V2 n Any) inside records","body":"--047d7b676b0a2bb3c50524bed794\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\nThe problem is that since def is polymorphic, and test1 accepts a\npolymorphic value but returns a monomorphic result, GHC has no way to\nchoose the types b and n in the expression 'text1 def :: Int'.  This is the\nsame problem as when you write something like   'show (read x)'.  This\nreally has nothing to do with putting QDiagram inside a record; you would\nhave the same problem if you replaced QDiagram b V2 n Any with, say,\n[(b,n)].\n\nThe solution is to fix the type of def, e..g by writing  (test1 (def ::\nSomeOpts Rasterific Double)), or you can make a function like\nasRasterific :: QDiagram Rasterific V2 Double Any -> QDiagram Rasterific V2\nDouble Any; asRasterific =3D id   and then write   test1 (asRasterific def)=\n.\n\n-Brent\n\nOn Tue, Nov 17, 2015 at 9:54 AM Jean Anthelme <janthelme@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> I am not sure if this question belongs here, but I try my luck.\n>\n> I am having trouble when trying to embed (QDiagram b V2 n Any) types\n> inside records.

, {"subject":"Re: [diagrams] diagrams-graphviz : edge labels position","body":"--047d7b41c6802accf90524505c88\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n\nHi Jean,\n\nDeveloping some general tools for doing this sort of labelling is high on\nour list, but so far no one has tackled it.  In the meantime there are\nvarious levels of doing it manually.  Note your example is especially\ntricky because you are using primitive text objects, for which we cannot\nknow the size.   So for now let's assume that all the edge labels have\nabout the same size.\n\nFirst, we can do a little better by putting the labels near the actual\nmidpoint of the edges instead of at the centroid of their endpoints (for\ncurved edges the centroid can be quite far from the edge).  To do this,\nsimply replace \"centroid [p1,p2]\" by something like \"head (pathTrails p)\n`atParam` 0.5\".\n\nNext, perhaps we don't want the labels right on top of the edges, but want\nto move them off to the side a bit.  The idea would be to find the normal\nvector at the edge midpoint, and move the label some distance along the\nnormal.  Replace \"centroid [p1,p2]\" with \"labelPt p\" where\n\nlabelPt p = ltr `atParam` 0.5 .+^ 20 *^ n\n  where\n    ltr = head (pathTrails p)\n    n = ltr `normalAtParam` 0.5\n\nThis is a bit better, but it does not take into account labels overlapping\nwith other edges, etc, nor does it take into account that if the labels are\nnot square, we may want to move them a different distance depending on the\nangle of the normal.  And perhaps you want to sometimes negate the normal\ndepending on the concavity of the edge, etc. etc. --- as you can see there\nare an infinite number of variations of varying difficulty.

In the meantime there are\nvarious levels of doing it manually.  Note your example is especially\ntricky because you are using primitive text objects, for which we cannot\nknow the size.   So for now let's assume that all the edge labels have\nabout the same size.\n\nFirst, we can do a little better by putting the labels near the actual\nmidpoint of the edges instead of at the centroid of their endpoints (for\ncurved edges the centroid can be quite far from the edge).  To do this,\nsimply replace \"centroid [p1,p2]\" by something like \"head (pathTrails p)\n`atParam` 0.5\".\n\nNext, perhaps we don't want the labels right on top of the edges, but want\nto move them off to the side a bit.  The idea would be to find the normal\nvector at the edge midpoint, and move the label some distance along the\nnormal.  Replace \"centroid [p1,p2]\" with \"labelPt p\" where\n\nlabelPt p = ltr `atParam` 0.5 .+^ 20 *^ n\n  where\n    ltr = head (pathTrails p)\n    n = ltr `normalAtParam` 0.5\n\nThis is a bit better, but it does not take into account labels overlapping\nwith other edges, etc, nor does it take into account that if the labels are\nnot square, we may want to move them a different distance depending on the\nangle of the normal.

Annotations are defined here:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/diagrams/diagrams-core/blob/master/src/Diagrams/Core/Types.hs#L253\n\nYou'll have to add a new constructor to that data type.  But I'm hoping\nthat a constructor specifying a key-value pair might be generically\nreusable for other things.  You'll want to also add a function, similar to\nthe href and opacityGroup functions defined just below, for creating one of\nthese new annotations.\n\nYou'll then have to modify the SVG backend to deal with these new\nannotations:\n\nhttps://github.com/diagrams/diagrams-svg/blob/master/src/Diagrams/Backend/SVG.hs#L266\n\nHere I have less of an idea of exactly what the right way will be to modify\nit.  You'll probably have to dig around a bit to figure out what the\nbackend is currently doing.  But you are welcome to ask questions on this\nlist or in the #diagrams IRC channel on Freenode, there are others who know\nmore than I about the details of the SVG backend.\n\n-Brent\n\nOn Sat, Oct 10, 2015 at 1:58 AM Reto Kramer <kramer@acm.org> wrote:\n\n> Hi Brent,\n>\n> Would love to work on doing this properly via the key-value pair\n> annotation you mention.
