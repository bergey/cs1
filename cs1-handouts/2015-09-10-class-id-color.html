<h1>Relating HTML to CSS</h1>

<h2>CSS Selectors</h2>

<dl>
<dt>element name</dt>
<dd>Any element name can be a CSS selector.  This applies to all emphasized text: <code>em { color: red; }</code></dd>

<dt>class</dt>
<dd>Any HTML element can have a class, and any number of elements can have the
same class.  In HTML, we add a class called "important" by writing <code>&lt;em
class="important"&gt;</code>  We can refer to that in CSS by writing <code>.important {/*properties here*/}</code></dd>

<dt>id</dt>
<dd>Any HTML element can have an ID attribute.  It's similar to a class, but
only one element in a document can have a given ID.  If you're not sure which to
use, use a class.   When we use Javascript, we'll see reasons to prefer an ID.
We refer to an ID in CSS with the # character, like <code>#myIdentity
{/*properties here*/} </dd>

</dl>

<h2>HTML Links</h2>

The <strong>a</strong> element, short for <em>anchor</em>, is used to make a
link.  The URL that is the destination of the link is given as the
<strong>href</strong> attribute.  The link text goes inside the
<strong>a</strong> element.  You can also have links that are images or divs,
instead of text.  An example: <code>&lt;a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"&gt;Click
Me!&lt;/a&gt;</code>


<h2>Color</h2>

<p>Often we want to specify a color in our CSS.  CSS defines a bunch of common
color names.  When you want a less common color,  you can specify it as the red,
green, and blue parts, in that order.  For example, <code>rgb(80%,0%,80%)</code>
is a shade of purple.  There are a few other ways, also, which you may see
reading others' code.  Without the % signs, each color component is a number
between 0 and 255 - dividing that number by 255 is the same as the percentage
value.  Or you may see <code>#CC00CC</code>, in which case each 2 numbers is one
color component, between 0 and 255, in base 16. As usual, you can <a

<p>Computer screens produce color by mixing different proportions of red, green,
and blue light.  They can't reproduce every color that occurs in the world (or
in print), but this works pretty well, because the human eye also has 3 kinds of
cell to detect color.  Computer monitors vary quite a bit in what color they
produce for a given set of numbers - so pick a color you like, but try not to
agonize too much over small differences.</p>
