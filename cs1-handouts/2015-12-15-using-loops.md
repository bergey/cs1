Use at least three loops to do something interesting.  At least one list should use a JavaScript list (add items to, or read items from).  Your program can display its output as HTML or on the Javascript console.

Use loops and lists to complete one of the following tasks.  Your solution should use at least 3 loops and at least one of the loops should use a JavaScript list.

- Count how many times each digit occurs in the list at the bottom of this file.  Store the counts in a list.  Display the results as a table in HTML or on the console.  You can start by writing a program that only counts zeros, which may be easier.  What if you wanted to count letters in a book instead?  Or words?  As the input and the number of different counts gets bigger, you really want a list and a loop, not a new variable name for every count!

- Modify your Mail page to insert the chat buddies, folders, and email usernames / senders from Javascript.  Use $.append to append an <li> for each element of the JS list.  This is a step towards the way GMail actually updates the page when you get new mail.  In the Spring, we will learn how to write Javascript that talks to another computer on the internet, as email needs to do to find out about new messages.  For now, just make a Javascript variable for each list.

- Write a program to calculate the first 40 prime numbers.  Store the primes in a list.  After calculating them, print them to the console with console.log.  (Expect this to be difficult.)

- If you have another idea that uses loops & lists, please discuss it with me first.
