    <p>Instead of reproducing a page designed by someone else, design your own page.  Some ideas:
      <ul>
        <li>A choose-your-own adventure story, with multiple pages and links between pages.</li>
        <li>A blog with a few posts, and the same HTML structure repeated for each.</li>
        <li>A personal homepage with a portfolio of your best (art?) work from the last few years.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Whatever the topic, the point is to show the HTML and CSS skills that you
      have learned so far this year.  Make your website as great as you know how.  The
      following are required to get an A:
      <ul>
        <li>At least 8 different HTML elements within the body of the document,
          used appropriately.  (&lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;link&gt; and the rest are not
          included in these 8.)</li>
        <li>A link to another page, either one you write or elsewhere on the web</li>
        <li>3 elements that share the same class</li>
        <li>At least 12 CSS selectors total</li>
        <li>At least one CSS selector by element name, one by ID, and one by class name</li>
        <li>At least 8 different CSS properties (eg, color, float, width, margin)</li>
        <li>At least one CSS media query, to set different CSS at different sizes</li>
        <li>Appropriate accomodations for at least one type of disability.
          It can be the one that you're researching, or any other
          researched by someone in class.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Save your project in the same folder with all your other projects, in a folder starting "08_"</p>
