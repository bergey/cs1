        <p>Often when writing code, we would like to save our work so we can go back
        to some previous version of the code.  Many of you have
        already told me, "This was working, now it doesn't, and I
        don't know what I changed." The longer you program, the more
        this will happen.  Follow these instructions to save steps
        along the way. You will also be handing in your project this
        way.</p>
        <p>The first 3 steps are needed once per project.  The rest
        are needed each time you save a version you may go back to.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Login to Cloud 9, and open your Dictionaries project</li>
            <li>In the Cloud 9 menu bar, select the <em>Cloud 9</em> menu (to the left of File) and the <em>Preferences</em> menu item.</li>
            <li>In the Preferences tab, open the <em>Experimental</em> list, and turn on <em>Changes Panel</em></li>

            <li>You should now see a <em>Changes</em> tab on the far left of the screen, vertically.  Select this tab.</li>
            <li>Below the Cloud 9 menu is a <em>Commit</em> menu. Click the arrows to the right of <em>Commit</em>, and select <em>Add All</em></li>
            <li>Click <em>Commit</em></li>
            <li>Enter a description of your changes, like "wrote parseDate".  Then click <em>Commit</em></li>
        </ol>
